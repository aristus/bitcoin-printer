This requires an astonishing collection of software in order to function.

* Python, probably 2.7 or so.
* The python-ecdsa library for crypto and light jazz music.
* python-qrcode is needed to generate... QR codes.
* python-qrcode requires PIL.
* PIL requires Freetype2.
* Freetype2 may, or may not, require the entire friggen X window system.
* X will require autoconf. But not the version you have already.
* You may get something like "_imagingft not found"
* Soon after, your exit will be blocked by a Spectral Wolf.
* The Spectral Wolf fears only fire. But if you master him, he will guide you.

Usage:

  $ ./paper_bitcoin.py AMOUNT

Where AMOUNT is a decimal number like "0.1". The default is "0.0001". This will
create a new keypair and bitcoin address, and generate the front and back images
for printing complete with QR codes and text. The filename will be in the form
"1SamPLE-0.01-front.png", where "1SamPLE" is the newly-minted Bitcoin address.
Remember to actually send the Bitcoin to that address!

If all you want is some hot crypto action, call generate_keypair by itself:

  $ ./generate_keypair.py
